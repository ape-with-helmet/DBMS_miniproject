This is a Database Manipulation project using MySQL. 
The project currently can only run on my system as the database is locally hosted. 
Will make the database public sometime in the future just for testing purposes.

To run the project,

run the following commands on one terminal
cd esports
npm start

and run the following on another terminal
cd BackEnd
npx nodemon main

If you like the project, do leave a star.
