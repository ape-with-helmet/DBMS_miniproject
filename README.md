# DBMS Project with React

This project is a Database Manipulation project using MySQL. Currently, the database is locally hosted and the project can only run on my system. However, I plan to make the database public in the future for testing purposes.

## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the following commands:
    ```bash
    cd esports
    npm start
    ```

3. Open another terminal and navigate to the `BackEnd` directory.

4. Run the following command to start the server:
    ```bash
    cd BackEnd
    npx nodemon main
    ```

If you find the project useful, consider leaving a star! Thank you for checking it out.
